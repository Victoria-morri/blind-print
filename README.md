to start this app you need:

1)get regular react node_modules;

2)install bootstrap : `npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap`;

3) `npm start`; You`ve done!)
 
If you have node version lowwer then v17.0.1, probably you don`t need this string `--openssl-legacy-provider start` in package.json => script => start && build

so just delete it.
